  <b>The</b> project began as part of the work for <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/t.clarke"> Dr. Tom Clarke's</a>
   functional programming course in F#. The aim was to create a replacement for <a href="https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/">
    VisUAL</a>, the program currently used to teach ARM assembly in Dr. Clarke's computer architecture course.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Armidello</b> is written entirely in F# but makes use of <a href="http://fable.io"> Fable</a>, an F# to JavaScript transpiler,
  and the <a href="https://electronjs.org"> Electron</a> framework.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  <b>A number</b> of features within Armidello have been developed specifically to assist beginners
  <ul>
    <li>The immediatly available memory map which intuitvely differentiates between contigious and non-contigious memory ensures users
      will never forget what's in memory.</li>
    <li>The ability to switch number representations from binary, hexadecimal, and signed or unsigned decimal helps users who are new
      are new to the idea of number representations.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Armidello</b> was developed by a team of three: <a href="https://github.com/Carotti">Tom Carotti</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/dougbrion">Doug Brion</a>, and myself. Tom worked mostly on the GUI, while Doug and I wrote the backend
  for the emulator.
</p>
<p>
  <b>The</b> project is now being continued by Dr. Clarke with the aim of fully replacing VisUAL in time for the start of his course
  in October 2018. All the code for Armidello is available on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/Carotti/vis-tally">here</a>.
