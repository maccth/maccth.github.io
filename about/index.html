  <b>Hello</b>, I'm Chris. I'm interested in solving problems.
</p>
<p>
  <b>So</b> far my journey of solving problems has led me to
  <ul>
    <li>study electronic and information engineering at Imperial College London, one of the world's greatest academic institutions</li>
    <li>work in investment banking technology at J.P. Morgan, one of the oldest and largest banks in the world</li>
    <li>collaborate with plenty of ridiculously smart people to create really cool things</li>
  </ul>
  and I feel like the journey has a long way to go yet.
</p>
<p>
  <b>My</b> interests lie in really understanding how things work and then using that knowledge to solve problems. Right now that interest
  has manifested itself in graphs and networks. Relational and object databases are great at stroing very structured information, but unintuitive
  when storing information that presents a multidimensional relationship. Travelling from your house to work can be thought of as a relationship
  in time, distance, or petrol (just to name a <i>few</i>). I'm interested in seeing if we can unite graphs and networks under one formalism,
  allowing us to understand, question, and query these relationships in a much more meaningful way.
</p>
<p>
  <b>I</b> also enjoy taking photos. I took most of the photos on this site and the others are from the generous people at <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>I've</b> worked with C++, Python, F#, SQL, Hadoop, Elixir and I've also dabbled with the web development stack. Of all of these languages, I
  found Elixir the most abstract and eye-opening, and the syntax of F# the most expressive.
</p>
<p>
    <b> Interestingly</b>, of all the well known languages, F# has the most keywords, while Elixir has the least (at a mere 19).
</p>
<p>
  <b>My</b> degree has also given me the luxury of spending a lot of time on the fence between hardware and software: utilising FPGAs, hardware description
  languages (such as Verilog), and high-level synthesis language (such as Catapult C). This is a really exciting field and it will be interesting to
  see these technologies gaining a presence amongst mainstream technology companies.
